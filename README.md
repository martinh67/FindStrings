# FindStrings

My assignment for week 6 for Fundamentals of Programming completed **10/01/2021**:

You are required to complete the following programming exercise:

Write a program that reads in a file containing several lines of text and then prints only those strings that end with the letters “ed”.

The program should do the following:

a.	Prompt the user for the name of a text file (if the file does not exist, display an error message and re-prompt)
b.	Read in a series of strings from the text file and store these in an array of strings, dynamically allocating memory for each element
c.	Loop through the populated string array and find elements that end with the characters "ed"
d.	Display on screen a list of only those strings that end with "ed"
